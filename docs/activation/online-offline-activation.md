# Online and Offline Activation

## Online Activation

In order to activate your copy of the Syskit Monitor: Navigate to the Backstage screen by clicking on the **File** tab, select **Help** from the left toolbar, then click on the **Activate** button and fill in all the required fields.

1. Login to our Customers Portal, navigate to the product key, and on the Activation dialog, write product key that has been provided to you upon purchase. The product key is a string in the following format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXX and it consists of letters and numbers.
2. Click the **Activate** button to start the key validation process. It only takes 2-5 seconds to perform the activation and it is a one-time-only procedure. If the validation of your key is successful, a green check mark will appear.
